OS stuff:
- interrupt table X
- keyboard inputs
- PIT timer
- PIT audio
- load more of the disk if necessary

Snake:

TODO:
- figure out how I/O ports work + out/in assembly instructions X
- learn what the PIC does and how to use it X
- implement interrupt requests X
- learn and implement PIT (almost)
- either PIC is not calling an interrupt, or the PIT is not communicating with the PIC
